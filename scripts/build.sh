# This library is one `.m31` file imported by another (or, for the examples,
# a standalone program of its own), compiled by the m31 compiler
# (m31c) and then linked, as ordinary C, against the m31 RUNTIME's own
# source files -- there is no pre-built runtime library to link against
# instead, so this script needs both:
#
#   - LANGC: the m31c compiler binary (env var, default ./m31c in the
#     repository root -- where a downloaded release binary lands).
#   - M31_ROOT: a directory containing the m31 project's own config.sh and
#     runtime/ (a checkout of github.com/qrazil/m31, or an extracted
#     release's bundled runtime SDK -- see that repo's own release.yml)
#     matching the version LANGC was built from. No default: a missing
#     M31_ROOT is a clear error instead of a guess.
